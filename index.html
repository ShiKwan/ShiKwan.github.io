					<p>This is a page about this dude on the left. He has three years of working experience as a programmer, during his free time, he plays a lot of badminton, cooks bunch of southeastern asian cuisines, and watches a lot of netflix. Occasionally, a dog would drop by his place to hang with him, they play fetch all day. </p>
					<p> He is awesome with VB.NET, however he did an average job with CSS styling, especially cleaning up the stylesheet.
